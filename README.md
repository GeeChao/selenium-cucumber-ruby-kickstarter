Selenium-Cucumber-Ruby-Kickstarter
================================

A quick example of how to bring Selenium, Cucumber and Ruby together to automate a Google Search

Each test run creates a log file and any failure will produce a screenshot, please see the relevant logs and screenshots folder following each run.

This is a very quick example to demo Ruby, Cucumber and Selenium Webdriver.Please email me with any thoughts or questions.

To get up and running:

1) Ensure you have the chrome browser and chromedriver setup
2) Ensure you have ruby installed (built and run with 1.9.2) - use rvm
3) Ensure you have rubygems and the bundler installed
4) Navigate to project
5) Run bundle install
6) Run rake

Enjoy that test run....

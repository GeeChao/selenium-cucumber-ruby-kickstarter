To run this test in chrome just pass the argument\r\n`-c chrome`  e.g. `cukesparse kickstarter -c chrome`   \r\n\r\n## Cukesparse Gem\r\n\r\nThe Selenium-Cucumber-Ruby-Kickstarter project uses the cukesparse gem which I created to easily pass default and custom arguments to Cucumber.\r\nTo find out more about this gem, please visit: https://github.com/jonathanchrisp/cukesparse\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\nI would be more than happy to recieve feedback, please email me at: jonathan.chrisp@gmail.com.\r\n","google":"UA-38101452-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
